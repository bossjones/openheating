* needs_cooling() alert scenarios

  a producer may have more than one transports attached, not all of
  which may be in a position to give appropriate cooling.

  do not raise alarm if at least one transport can give cooling.

* introduce some common "do poll me" interface (aka Transport.move())

* WolfBurner: better switch definitions. switches are naturally closed
  or open initially, should we intro

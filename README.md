Heating Control System
======================

Will once solve my needs for a heating control system which
comprehends a historically grown constellation.

* Two heat sources
  * Oil (fully automatic)
  * Wood (manual firing, in the living room). Wood currently dominates oil in a brutal way, in that a bi-metal switch disbles oil burning abruptly.
* Two heat sinks
  * Water; a 1000l buffer, where potable water is exchanged through
  * Radiators across the house, in a single circuit

There is a third possible heat source: a solar panel, producing hot
water when sun is on. Heats up the water buffer in a separate circuit,
controlled by a separate unit (which works and need not be replaced).

There is a circuit which can take heat from hot water. When there is
sun there is hot water. If the house needs heating (nights are still
cold), this could be done. Currently it cannot.

Wish List
---------

While the main inpetus for this project is to bring my own system to
its intended functionality, a definitive intent is to keep things
apart as far as possible. For example, I have a wood/oil combination
of heat sources. Software contains separate classes for each, combined
by a dedicated third class.

This is a higher level wish list, by decreasing priority. Details are
found in the issue tracker.

* Coordinate heat sources and sinks in an intelligent automatic way
  * When wood heat is coming, oil should be faded out gently (there's plenty of time).
  * A switching valve is currently turned manually; this is due to that "heating control" we currently have. (Was about â‚¬300, gosh)
* Bring the spare hot water in house heating. Not prio-1 right now, but will come.
* Control solar water. Works as-is, so low prio. Can be done when all else is mature; will be trivial then.
  * Thought: integrate with water buffer's mechanism. He needs heat when there's no sun, during night for example. Could read weather forecast and defer his need.
* This list can be extended to no end

Inner Beauty
------------

* Written in Python3
* Distributed using DBus, to provide
  * Sensors over Ethernet/TCP (I distribute them across the house, using Raspies)
  * Displays
  * Remote controls
  * Configuration using dconf (way in the future though)
  * (whatever)
